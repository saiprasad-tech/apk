# Pixhawk_GCS Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from "Pixhawk GCS Lite" (pure Android) to "Pixhawk_GCS" (hybrid Android/Qt/C++) architecture, incorporating elements from the BDA-Lab repository.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Project Structure Transformation
```
OLD: pixhawk-gcs-lite (Android Kotlin only)
└── app/src/main/java/com/pixhawk/gcslite/

NEW: Pixhawk_GCS (Hybrid Android/Qt/C++)
├── CMakeLists.txt              # Root CMake configuration
├── app/src/main/java/com/pixhawk/gcs/    # Rebranded Android code  
├── src/cpp/                    # C++ backend
│   ├── core/MavlinkCore.*     # MAVLink processing
│   └── jni/MavlinkJNI.cpp     # JNI bridge
├── src/qml/main.qml           # Qt/QML components
└── resources/qml.qrc          # Qt resources
```

### 2. Architecture Enhancement
- **Android Layer**: Preserved existing Jetpack Compose UI with Material 3
- **C++ Backend**: Added high-performance MAVLink processing core
- **JNI Bridge**: Seamless integration between Android and C++ 
- **Qt Components**: Optional QML interface for cross-platform development
- **Build System**: Hybrid Gradle + CMake supporting both Android NDK and Qt6

### 3. Rebranding Complete
- Application name: "Pixhawk GCS Lite" → "Pixhawk GCS"
- Package name: `com.pixhawk.gcslite` → `com.pixhawk.gcs` 
- Project name: `pixhawk-gcs-lite` → `Pixhawk_GCS`
- Theme: `PixhawkGCSLiteTheme` → `PixhawkGCSTheme`

### 4. New Features Added
- **Hybrid Demo Screen**: Shows performance comparison between Kotlin and C++ backends
- **C++ MAVLink Core**: Native high-performance message processing
- **JNI Interface**: Bridges Android UI with C++ processing
- **Qt Integration**: Optional QML components for enhanced features
- **Cross-Platform Build**: Supports Android, desktop Qt, and hybrid configurations

## Technical Implementation

### Build System
- **Gradle**: Manages Android application and dependencies
- **CMake**: Compiles C++ code for Android NDK and desktop Qt
- **JNI**: Runtime bridge between Java/Kotlin and C++
- **Qt6**: Optional QML UI components and cross-platform features

### Backend Architecture  
```
Android UI (Kotlin/Compose) 
    ↓ JNI calls
C++ Core (MavlinkCore)
    ↓ Optional Qt integration  
QML Components (Desktop/Mobile)
```

### Performance Benefits
- C++ backend provides faster MAVLink message processing
- JNI bridge enables seamless data exchange
- Hybrid approach maintains Android UX while adding performance
- Qt components enable cross-platform feature development

## Build Configurations

1. **Android-Only**: Standard Android Studio build (most users)
2. **Android + C++**: Full hybrid build with NDK (performance)  
3. **Qt Desktop**: Cross-platform development and testing

## Migration Success

✅ **Preserved Functionality**: All existing Android features maintained  
✅ **Enhanced Performance**: Added C++ backend for critical processing  
✅ **Improved Architecture**: Hybrid system supports multiple platforms  
✅ **Updated Branding**: Complete rebrand to Pixhawk_GCS  
✅ **Build Integration**: Seamless CMake + Gradle workflow  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive build and architecture docs  

## Usage

The migrated application can now be:
- Built as standard Android app in Android Studio
- Extended with high-performance C++ components  
- Developed with cross-platform Qt/QML features
- Deployed to multiple platforms (Android primary, desktop optional)

This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: native Android performance and user experience, with the flexibility of cross-platform C++/Qt development.
